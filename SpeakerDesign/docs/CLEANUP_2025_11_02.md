# Codebase Cleanup - 2025-11-02

## Files Moved

### To docs/archive/
- `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Old refactor documentation (pre-Phase 1)
- `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Old testing documentation (pre-Phase 1)

### To examples/ (new directory)
- `example.html` - Foundation library minimal usage example
- `foundation.html` - Foundation library interactive showcase

### Deleted
- `ui/compare.html` - Legacy comparison page (superseded by Project system)

## Current Structure

### Root Files (Clean)
```
README.md - Project overview
ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture
CLAUDE.md - Project-specific AI instructions
```

### UI Files (Active)
```
ui/index.html - Main application (BoxSmith)
ui/driver-browser.html - Driver database browser
ui/app.js - Main application logic
ui/graphs.js - Chart rendering
ui/styles.css - Application styles
```

### Documentation
```
docs/
├── UX_REDESIGN_PLAN.md - Phase 1 plan
├── PHASE1_PROGRESS.md - Phase 1 implementation tracker
├── PHASE1_CLEANUP.md - Phase 1 technical debt removal
└── archive/ - Historical documentation
```

### Examples
```
examples/
├── README.md - Examples documentation
├── example.html - Minimal Foundation usage
└── foundation.html - Interactive showcase
```

### Library
```
lib/
├── foundation/ - 189 tested Thiele-Small equations
├── models/ - Driver, SealedBox, PortedBox, Project
├── calculators/ - SPL, MaxPower, Alignment
├── test/ - Test suite (189 tests passing)
└── validation/ - Parameter validation
```

## Rationale

**Why archive REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md?**
- Documented refactor work completed before Phase 1
- No longer relevant to current implementation
- Kept in archive for historical reference

**Why archive TESTING_CHECKLIST.md?**
- Old testing approach (pre-Project system)
- Phase 1 has its own testing checklist in PHASE1_PROGRESS.md
- Kept in archive for reference

**Why move examples/?**
- Foundation showcase files are development/learning tools
- Not part of main application
- Cleaner root directory

**Why delete compare.html?**
- Superseded by Project system (multi-design overlay)
- Used separate localStorage ('compareDesigns')
- Confusing to have two comparison systems
- Users should migrate to new Project system

**Why keep driver-browser.html?**
- Functional and useful
- Independent feature (browse drivers)
- Could integrate better in Phase 2+

## What's Left

**Root:** 3 essential docs
**UI:** 2 active HTML files (index, driver-browser)
**Docs:** 4 files + archive directory
**Examples:** 2 demo files + README
**Library:** All essential code
**Tests:** All passing

**Total cleanup:** 5 files moved, 1 deleted
**Result:** Clean, organized codebase ready for Phase 2
