Graph Type: Maximum Power

Description:
Shows maximum safe power handling vs frequency, limited by either excursion (Xmax) or thermal (Pe) constraints. Critical graph for validating our displacement and power limit calculations.

Key Observations:
- Below ~40-45Hz: Excursion limited, power rises rapidly with frequency
- At ~45Hz: Transition point where excursion limit meets thermal limit
- Above ~50Hz: Thermal limited, flat at 1200W (Pe)
- At 10Hz: ~400W maximum safe power
- At 20Hz: ~450-500W maximum safe power
- At 30Hz: ~700W maximum safe power
- At 40Hz: ~1100W maximum safe power
- Smooth transition from excursion to thermal limiting

Critical for Validation:
This is THE KEY GRAPH for testing our displacement formula. Our current code shows:
- 10Hz: 129W (WinISD: 400W) - 3x OFF
- 20Hz: 623W (WinISD: 475W) - WRONG DIRECTION
- Transition: 27Hz (WinISD: 45Hz) - 18Hz OFF

The huge discrepancy at 10Hz (3x) suggests our displacement calculation is fundamentally wrong.
