Graph Type: Driver T/S Parameters

Description:
Thiele-Small and electro-mechanical parameters for the Dayton Audio UMII18-22 driver as entered in WinISD. These are the REFERENCE values that must be used for validation testing.

Key Observations:
CRITICAL: These parameters differ from what we had in our driver-params.json!

Thiele/Small parameters:
- Qes: 0.670 (not 0.46!)
- Qms: 2.530 (not 4.35!)
- Qts: 0.530 (not 0.43!)
- Fs: 22.00 Hz (not 26.5!)
- Vas: 248.20 L (not 330!)

Electro-Mechanical parameters:
- Mms: 420.0 g (not 165!)
- Cms: 0.1240 mm/N
- Rms: 23.05978 N·s/m
- Re: 4.200 ohm (not 6.4!)
- BL: 38.40000 T·m/A (not 23.5!)
- Dd: 388.3 mm
- Le: 1.15 mH
- Sd: 1184.0 cm²

Large-Signal parameters:
- Xmax: 28.0 mm peak (not 18!)
- Pe: 1200.0 W
- Vd: 3.32 L

Extractable Data:
These EXACT values must be copied to driver-params.json for validation testing.

Impact on Testing:
We were testing with WRONG driver parameters! This explains some of the discrepancy:
- Higher Fs (26.5 vs 22) pushes resonance higher
- Lower Qts (0.43 vs 0.53) changes damping
- Smaller Xmax (18 vs 28) makes it excursion-limited earlier
- Different BL/Re changes force factor and current draw

MUST update our test parameters to match these values exactly.
